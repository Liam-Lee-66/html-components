        <h3>Have you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?</h3>
        <ol type="A" start="10">
            <li>thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. <li>
            <li>It's a Sith legend.</li>
            <li>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life...</li>
            <li>He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</li>
            <li>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</li>
            <li>He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.</li>
            <li>It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</li>
