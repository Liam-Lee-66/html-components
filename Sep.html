        <h3>Blasters During the Clone Wars</h3>
        <p>This website will be explaining about Blaster rifles used between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists.</p>
        <p>The reason is simple, there are too many types of models from different planets. Also, both the Galactic Republic and the Separatists are organized to use specific Blasters throughout the war.</p>
